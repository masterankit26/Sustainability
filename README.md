🌍 Smart Precision Farming for Water Conservation

An AI + IoT powered precision agriculture solution designed to help farmers conserve water, reduce costs, and improve crop yields. The system integrates IoT sensors, AI-driven analytics, precision irrigation, and renewable energy monitoring to deliver the right amount of water at the right time, ensuring both sustainability and profitability.

🚜 Key Features
📍 Location-Aware Farming

Farmers can enter latitude & longitude or simply use “My Current Location” to auto-detect their farm.

Location data is used to fetch real-time weather forecasts, evapotranspiration data, and regional crop water requirements.

🌐 Integrated IoT Solution

Multi-Sensor Network Architecture

Soil Moisture Sensors: Wireless sensors at 15cm, 30cm, and 60cm depths.

Weather Monitoring: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.

Plant Health Monitoring: Spectral sensors detect stress indicators early.

Edge Computing Nodes: Real-time on-field data processing for faster decisions.

🤖 AI-Powered Water Management Engine

Integrates IoT + weather + crop data to generate dynamic irrigation schedules.

Features:

Soil moisture predictions from historical + forecast data

Crop-specific water requirement modeling (by growth stage)

Evapotranspiration-based calculations for accuracy

Root-zone optimization to prevent drought stress & waterlogging

💧 Precision Delivery System

Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI): Zone-specific water distribution.

Smart Valve Controllers: Remote activation + flow monitoring.

Drip & Micro-Sprinkler Integration: Maximizing efficiency.

Automated Nutrient Injection: Synchronizing irrigation + fertigation.

⚡ Real-Time Energy Dashboard (New Feature)

Powered by Open-Meteo Solar API

Provides hourly solar irradiance data for the farm’s location.

Converts irradiance into solar power generation (kW), energy usage, and CO₂ saved.

Benefits for farmers:

Aligns irrigation pumping with solar energy availability, reducing electricity costs.

Enables sustainable, renewable energy usage on the farm.

Tracks real-time CO₂ emissions avoided, supporting eco-friendly practices.

Integrates with AI irrigation engine for optimized water + energy management.

🚀 Key Innovations

Predictive Water Scheduling: Forecasts water needs 3–7 days in advance.

Dynamic Zone Management: Auto-divides farms by soil, crop, and topography.

Weather Integration: Cancels irrigation before predicted rainfall.

Mobile Command Center: Real-time farmer alerts + analytics dashboard.

🌱 Crop Performance Enhancement

✅ 15–20% higher crop yields from optimized irrigation
✅ 30% fewer crop stress incidents
✅ Consistent crop quality during critical growth stages

💰 Economic Benefits

💧 $200–400 per acre annual water savings (for typical vegetables)
👩‍🌾 20–30% reduction in irrigation labor costs
🛡️ Insurance premium reductions in some regions
🔐 Secure data storage with end-to-end encryption + blockchain logs

📊 ROI Simulation Tool

Calculate potential savings:

Water Saved (liters/day)

Electricity Cost Savings (₹/day)

Annual ROI (%)

How it Works:

Farmer inputs:

Crop type (from categorized dropdown)

Farm area (acres)

Electricity cost (₹/unit)

Backend calculates crop-specific water requirements:

Assumes 30% water savings with smart irrigation

1 electricity unit ≈ 1000 liters pumped

ROI assumes ₹5000/acre investment

Results are displayed instantly in the React frontend dashboard, along with energy insights from solar generation.

Example Simulation:

Input: Area → 5 acres, Crop → Rice 🌾, Electricity Rate → ₹7/unit

Output:

💧 Water Saved → 9000 liters/day

💰 Cost Savings → ₹63/day

📈 ROI → ~46% per year
