🌍 Smart Precision Farming for Water Conservation

An AI + IoT powered precision agriculture solution designed to help farmers conserve water, reduce costs, and improve crop yields. The system integrates IoT sensors, AI-driven analytics, and precision irrigation to deliver the right amount of water at the right time, ensuring both sustainability and profitability.


🚜 Key Features
📍 Location-Aware Farming

Farmers can enter latitude & longitude or simply use “My Current Location” to auto-detect their farm.

Location data is used to fetch real-time weather forecasts, evapotranspiration data, and regional crop water requirements.

🌐 Integrated IoT Solution
Multi-Sensor Network Architecture

Soil Moisture Sensors: Wireless sensors at 15cm, 30cm, and 60cm depths.

Weather Monitoring: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.

Plant Health Monitoring: Spectral sensors detect stress indicators early.

Edge Computing Nodes: Real-time on-field data processing for faster decisions.

🤖 AI-Powered Water Management Engine

Our machine learning algorithms integrate IoT + weather + crop data to generate dynamic irrigation schedules:

Soil moisture predictions from historical + forecast data.

Crop-specific water requirement modeling (by growth stage).

Evapotranspiration-based calculations for accuracy.

Root-zone optimization to prevent drought stress & waterlogging.

💧 Precision Delivery System

Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI): Zone-specific water distribution.

Smart Valve Controllers: Remote activation + flow monitoring.

Drip & Micro-Sprinkler Integration: Maximizing efficiency.

Automated Nutrient Injection: Synchronizing irrigation + fertigation.

🚀 Key Innovations

Predictive Water Scheduling → Forecasts water needs 3–7 days in advance.

Dynamic Zone Management → Auto-divides farms by soil, crop, and topography.

Weather Integration → Cancels irrigation before predicted rainfall.

Mobile Command Center → Real-time farmer alerts + analytics dashboard.

🌱 Crop Performance Enhancement

✅ 15–20% higher crop yields from optimized irrigation.

✅ 30% fewer crop stress incidents.

✅ Consistent crop quality during critical growth stages.

💰 Economic Benefits

💧 $200–400 per acre annual water savings (for typical vegetables).

👩‍🌾 20–30% reduction in irrigation labor costs.

🛡️ Insurance premium reductions in some regions.

🔐 Secure data storage with end-to-end encryption + blockchain logs.

📊 ROI Simulation Tool

Alongside IoT + AI solutions, we provide a farmer-friendly Simulation Tool to calculate:

💧 Water Saved (liters/day)

💰 Electricity Cost Savings (₹/day)

📈 Annual ROI (%)

🔧 How it Works

Farmers input:

🌾 Crop type (from dropdown categorized by cereals, pulses, fruits, vegetables, commercial crops, etc.)

📐 Farm area (acres)

⚡ Electricity cost (₹/unit)

The backend (Flask) calculates using crop-specific water requirements:

Assumes 30% water savings with smart irrigation.

1 electricity unit ≈ 1000 liters pumped.

ROI assumes ₹5000/acre investment.

Results are shown instantly in the React frontend dashboard.

📋 Example Simulation

Input:

Area → 5 acres

Crop → Rice 🌾

Electricity Rate → ₹7/unit

Output:

💧 Water Saved → 9000 liters/day

💰 Cost Savings → ₹63/day

📈 ROI → ~46% per year
